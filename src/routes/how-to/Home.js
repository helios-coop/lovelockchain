            Love Lock Chain lets you record your love for all time. The Ethereum
            blockchain is long list of transactions or records. This list is
            distributed across tens of thousands of servers all around the
            world. Each server maintains a record of all transactions ever
            recorded to the blockchain. If one server tries to alter these
            transactions the other servers will recject the alterations. In this
            way, once a transaction is recorded it will be there forever.
            Diamonds may be forever, but Blockchains are Immutable.
          </p>

            Love Lock Chain allows you to create a romantic note for someone
            that gets recorded to the Ethereum blockchain. It&apos;s kinda like
            carving a heart and names onto a tree. In this case no trees gdt
            hurt and no one can cut down the blockchain. In 200 yrs your great
            grandkids can come find your note.
          </p>

            Creating a romantic note on the blochchain is super simple.
            <ul>
              <li>
                First off make sure you have some ether in your meta mask
                account. A note costs 0.0005 Ether, plus a bit more for the
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ensure you are logged into your Meta Mask account. Generally
                you&apos;ll be logged out if you haven&apos;t recently used it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Go to this page and
                <a href="http://lovelockchain.com/new"> create a note here</a>
              </li>
              <li>After creating a note, Meta Mask will popup for approval.</li>

                GWEI Make sure to set the <bold>gas</bold> price to at least 10
                GWEI or the transaction might not finish.
